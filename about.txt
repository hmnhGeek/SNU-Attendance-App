Version 1.0
SNU Attendance App
-------------------

AUTHOR: Himanshu Sharma

With the new Multi-Core processing, this app is powerful enough to do many tasks at a time.
Mark your attendance and view your attendance. If you have an attendance below 75 %, then it will
warn you too. It will also tell you the number of classes you need to attend to cover up. So, sit back
and relax. One click and its done. This is made possible by the multi-processing approach.
